The influence of other musical genres doesn&rsquo;t stop there, as we can also trace the influence of other Latin genres such as bachata and salsa, which are in their own right already Spanish speaking genres.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13">The Puerto Rican Underworld and Street Networks Reggaet&oacute;n&rsquo;s ties to the narco-world</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">The history of this musical movement is also associated with criminality, starting from the distribution of the music which was distributed illegally. During the 1990s, several records of underground were confiscated. The lyrics of the music and the defiance of authority, the message of usage of drugs, the crude references to sex made underground music a target for police persecution</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Rivera, 112). One of the most well-known producers of that era is DJ Playero, who produced mixtapes featuring several artists, naming them after his stage name &ldquo;Playero&rdquo; and the number of the mixtape. That is the most well-known name of the underground era, as he introduced artists who later became the face of reggaeton, as it is the case with Daddy Yankee, who also started his music career in the 1990s.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c16">Distribution and crude lyrics were not the only illegal activities related to reggaeton, but also later on real involvement with the underworld, related to money laundering, drug trafficking and illegal arms distribution (Noticias). Alongside the creation of underground in Puerto Rico, the underworld entities on the island started to form a new alliance called &ldquo;La </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizacion_de_Narcotraficantes_Unidos&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011097987&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VJytucRZgaqfzpeLg45Zp">ONU</a></span><span class="c7 c16">&rdquo; (Organizaci&oacute;n de Narcotraficantes Unidos) (United Drug Traffickers Organization), mocking the acronym of </span><span class="c7 c16">ONU</span><span class="c1">, which is the United Nations acronym in Spanish.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">This organized crime entity was founded by three drug lords, Angel Ayala Vasquez, also known as &ldquo;El Boster&rdquo; or &ldquo;Angelo Millones&rdquo;, Jos&eacute; &ldquo;Coquito&rdquo; L&oacute;pez Rosario, also known as &ldquo;Coco Blin Blin&rdquo; and Pito Paz. This organization had the objective to reunite all the local gangs of Puerto Rico and make them collaborate and work together for a better and more &ldquo;pacific&rdquo; control of the territories of the island.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c16">Reggaeton comes into the equation when it became a source of income for these criminals. Music studios and labels were founded like Blin Blin Records, founded by Coco Blin Blin himself, this label produced several mixtapes and albums for several artists, some were even close friends to the drug lords, like the case of Hector &ldquo;El Father,&rdquo; who was a friend since childhood of Pito Paz. The alliance was not only between criminals but with the reggaeton artists, as they were hired to perform for free in the public housing projects paid by these drug lords. This fostered sympathy between the underworld and marginalized Puerto Rican communities facing poverty. Apparently, they also controlled violent crimes, and according to some people, there was a whole year in which the alliance practiced a truce and no murders were committed for that year and although that information is difficult to confirm, it&rsquo;s also difficult to ignore (Mario VI, </span><span class="c7 c16 c10">Episodio 4, 1:10:19</span><span class="c1">). The dissolution of La ONU started in the middle of the 2000s when criminals involved parted their ways with the alliance and created organizations such as &ldquo;La Rompe ONU&rdquo; (ONU Breakers) and killed both Coco Blin Blin and Pito Paz. &ldquo;A few years later, La ONU&rsquo;s most prominent figure, El Boster (Angelo Millones) was arrested and is currently serving time in prison (&ldquo;Sixty-Five Members of the Angel Ayala Vazquez Drug Trafficking Organization Indicted $100 Million Forfeiture Count&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">The involvement of the underworld in Reggaeton stopped being so explicit after these events, but the glorification of these people in songs, concerts and even movies is still present. We can hear a lot of Don Omar songs from 2003 to 2006 where El Boster is mentioned, there is a whole reggaeton movie with Daddy Yankee is the main character called &ldquo;Talento de Barrio&rdquo; where Coco Blin Blin appears, when music videos were recorded in the projects, artists got the permission from the drug lords, not the government as it was the case for Gangsta Zone by Daddy Yankee ft. Snoop Dogg. Numerous tributes to Coco Blin Blin and Pito Paz exist, including songs and murals. As for El Boster, he is still remembered in Reggaeton as a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; for the most part and his face and name are often referenced to this day as it is the case with Don Omar who wears a hoodie with the face of El Boster printed on it as well as a cap with the word &ldquo;Free&rdquo;, giving therefore the message to Free Angelo Millones.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13">Gender in Reggaet&oacute;n: From Object to Subject</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Gender concepts inside the Latin urban scene are still considered a taboo subject; it is no secret that it is a male-dominated music genre to the present, and it was even more male-dominated in the past. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that there were no feminine figures in the Reggaeton industry since the beginning. We can trace two of the most famous ones to the beginning of the 2000s. Glory Glou and Ivy Queen are both pioneering female figures in reggaet&oacute;n and have shared their views on women&rsquo;s empowerment inside Reggaeton. Glory is famously recognized as the woman&rsquo;s voice in La Gasolina by Daddy Yankke &ldquo;Dame m&aacute;s gasolina&rdquo;, but her career has been fundamental for reggaeton, from the lyrics to the themes, the composition and the structure of the songs. The call and response, &ldquo;pregones&rdquo; heard in songs such as &ldquo;la Gasolina&rdquo; by Daddy Yankee or &ldquo;Baila Morena&rdquo; BY H&eacute;ctor &amp; Tito were all by Glory. She even releases her own album called Glou in which the most popular track &ldquo;</span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Popola&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011106391&amp;usg=AOvVaw0PxGDuDjMad31A0JgTAYMl">La popola</a></span><span class="c5">&rdquo; which is a slang word that refers to the female genitalia and a lot of metaphors, about consent and sexual expression, one of the first women in reggaet&oacute;n to be that explicit about her own sexuality. Another example of pioneer women in Reggaeton is Ivy Queen. She takes a whole different approach with her song &ldquo;Quiero Bailar&rdquo; released in 2004, one of the best reggaeton songs ever and a classic in which the general message of the song is not only about dancing or seduction but also consent, &ldquo;Eso no quiere decir que pa la cama voy&hellip;&rdquo; (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m going to bed.) She also called herself la caballota (The big female horse) using the term to empower herself.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Later on, the Latin urban genre has gained a lot more women who offer always a different perspective on the typical reggaeton topics such as love, cheating, violence and party. Global artists such as Karol G have became the new face of women in reggaeton, Karol G uses a similar strategy as Ivy Queen by calling herself &ldquo;La Bichota&rdquo; which it&rsquo;s original meaning is the femenine term for the Big Shot or Drug Lord in Puerto Rico but by changing it completely to a woman who lives on the block and is admired by every other girl and desires by every man but is considered tough and resilient. Karol G and Ivy Queen have collaborated several times but a notable collaboration is &ldquo;LEYENDAS&rdquo; where they do some type of Remake of &ldquo;Yo quiero Bailar&rdquo; along with other legends of the musical genre such as Wisin &amp; Yandel.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Argentinian singer Cazzu wrote a book titled</span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/813540/perreo-una-revolucion--twerk-a-revolution-by-cazzu/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011110118&amp;usg=AOvVaw2RNT0Nc8eiZeRuuNTQRyAS">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c0 c10"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/813540/perreo-una-revolucion--twerk-a-revolution-by-cazzu/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011110363&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WvW2nJofChFS04GFRDqVa">Perreo: Una Revoluci&oacute;n</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(making reference to the dancing style used for reggaeton and trap) where she defended herself and the reggaeton genre from polemic surrounding the genre. She talked about how consent is explicit in most Reggaeton classics and women are free to do what they want with their sexuality, how patriarchy wants to control women and blame them if they are victims and this type of music could be in a way empowering. Cazzu alongside another Chilean artists from Chile called Nina MS have been pioneers of a sub-genre called &ldquo;Neo-Perreo&rdquo; where there is a more obscure and raw aesthetic mixed with electronic and futuristic sounds focused on the women&rsquo;s expression as well as the LGBT community. Other known artists of this subgenre are Rosal&iacute;a who became internationally popular with her album &ldquo;Motomami&rdquo;,Arca, one of the first trans women in reggaet&oacute;n and a respected producer and Kevin Fret who was the first openly gay artist that made trap in Puerto Rico but was unfortunately murdered in 2019 in suspicious circumstances where it is even theorized that he was victim of a hate crime. There is no verdict or sufficient evidence to confirm this claim)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13">Importance of collaboration in Reggaet&oacute;n</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">One of the characteristics of Reggaeton besides its topics and aesthetics is related to the people involved in &nbsp;musical projects. Reggaeton is known to be one of the genres in spanish with more Duets, musical groups with two people. Examples such as Wisin &amp; Yandel, Jowell &amp; Randy, Angel y Khriz and Zion &amp; Lennox are some of the artists that chose to collaborate because they saw the strength in collaboration. Most of these duets are conformed by the rapper and the singer which gives most of the song a structure to follow. Collaboration is not only by Duets but also between solo artists. This practice has been key for the growth of Reggaeton and also for the discovery of new talents. One of the most important producers in Reggaeton, Arnaldo Santos who goes by his stage name Naldo, created an Album in 2005 called &ldquo;Sangre Nueva&rdquo; (New Blood) this album&rsquo;s premise was simple. Reggaeton veterans mentoring new talents. Daddy Yankee, H&eacute;ctor &ldquo;El Father&rdquo;, Wisin, Yandel, Tego Calder&oacute;n and others mentored new talents by recording songs in duet with their &ldquo;new blood&rdquo; and it is from this album that artists like Arcangel, Yomo and &Ntilde;engo Flow had their upbringing in this genre. Since before Sangre Nueva times, they discovered that collaboration is beneficial for every party, especially fornew artists gain exposure by collaborating with established stars. This strategy is one of the reasons that Reggaeton has stayed so relevant for such a long time, it has been a &ldquo;Relay race&rdquo; older artists allowing newer artists to have the spotlight or even new artists giving back the spotlight to older artists with collaborations as it is the case with Bad Bunny in his hit album &ldquo;Un verano sin Ti&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Silenced Voices: Lele El Arma Secreta and Jenny &ldquo;La Sexy Voz&rdquo;, &nbsp;ghostwriting and lyrical influence</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Throughout the history of Reggaeton, there have been several voices that have been silenced. They either haven&#39;t received the recognition they deserve, they have been erased from the credits of songs, or have been forgotten despite their enormous contributions to the genre. One of the main objectives of this project was to light up Reggaeton entities that are now forgotten. The composer and ghostwriter, Victor Alexis Rivera Santiago, also known as &quot;Lele El Arma Secreta&quot;, has an incredible story. Although he still has a solid fan base, he is not recognized enough by the general public, despite his deserving recognition. He was born in Puerto Rico the 17th of September 1986, his friends and family describe him as someone who is neurodivergent, someone who has coordination problems and can&rsquo;t even do his shoelaces, but he has great talent writing poetry and songs. In his teenage years he was heavily bullied and this may be one of the reasons he decided to be associated with the streets of Puerto Rico. At the age of 16 he was discovered by renowned Reggaeton Artists such as Hector &ldquo;El Father&rdquo; and Don Chezina, they noticed his talent and decided to hire him as a songwriter. In 2003, he was hired in the then emerging music company Goldstar Music by Hector El Father, there are sources that say that he signed for salary contract instead of royalties (having no legal advice whatsoever) and for five years he worked alongside Hector and his team and composed some of the most known reggaeton songs of all time and most famous Hector el father songs such as &ldquo;Noche de Travesura&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dale Castigo&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tu quieres duro&rdquo;, &ldquo;El Telefono&rdquo; among others. When the music company went bankrupt in 2008 and Hector decided to retire and become an evangelical preacher, he demanded for his fair share for all the songs he wrote. His stance was understandable because how was it possible that there were people earning millions for the work he did and he himself, the author was not having any royalties and the company that was giving him his salary didn&#39;t exist anymore, he did a lot of work and from all of that he didn&#39;t earn any passive income that could have saved his life. In 2008, after parting ways with Goldstar Music, he created his own Reggaeton duet with the singer Endo and formed the Endo &amp; Lele project. For over a year and half, they released over 70 songs, and he even found a place in the rapper Cosculluela&rsquo;s company Rottweila&rsquo;s inc. where he also wrote several songs, notably &quot;Prrrum&quot; which is Cosculluela&rsquo;s biggest success to date. Unfortunately, the 1st of July 2010, Lele was found dead in his car, possibly murdered for his affiliations with La ONU by members of &ldquo;La Rompe-ONU&rdquo; since he released a diss-track for that organization a few days earlier of his assassination, there are also rumours that he was betrayed by members of La ONU after he had problems with a drug lord&rsquo;s son, they managed to find and arrest the material perpetrator of his murder but not the intellectual author. This is not the story of a martyr or a saint, but rather of a talented young man who made plenty of bad decisions in his life and was also treated unfairly by others, including not being given the credit or recognition he deserved from the start in the genre. Considering that he was a young man with no legal guidance, people took advantage of this to make business deals, and in the end, this deprived him of economic and educational opportunities that could have helped him stay away from the streets. This tragedy could have been avoided if Lele had received more support from the people he worked with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Another story of silenced voices of Reggaet&oacute;n is Jenny &ldquo;La Sexy Voz&rdquo; (the sexy voice). Jennifer Marie D&aacute;vila was born the 24th of October 1988 in Puerto Rico. At the age of 16 she was working as a model by promoting rum and other drinks as well as model in music videos. in 2004 she met with Alexis &amp; Fido, a famous reggaeton duo, and they asked her to record some voices for their new son &ldquo;El Palo&rdquo;, they told her the recordings were demos and her voice would be replaced before release, she agreed, but they never changed her voice and the track was released with her work. The song had a notable success and after that, a lot of Reggaeton artists wanted her voice to be in their songs, that is how Hector El Father took interest in her and added her voice to most of his popular songs of that era including the whole &quot;Los Bacatranes&quot; Album by Tr&eacute;bol Clan produced by Hector himself. She also used her voice for Wisin &amp; Yandel songs, mostly for the album &quot;Pa&rsquo;l Mundo&quot;, in which every song she&rsquo;s in became a classic. Because she worked on the same company as Lele, they personally knew each other and were friends, and they also collaborated for an Endo &amp; Lele song called &ldquo;Frontua&rdquo; although it looks more as a professional favor than a business deal. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">She is now seen as a silenced voice because even if her voice is in at least 80 Reggaeton songs from which at least 40 are timeless classics, she is not credited in most of the songs, and she receives no royalties for her contributions., she mentioned in a live stream that they were only one-time payments and although the information of the payment is not public nor exact, they were not substantial payments. In the early 2010s she started a solo career in which she collaborated with essential figures of Reggaeton like Arcangel and future promises like Farruko and Maluma which are now internationally known for their music. Her career as solo artist was not as successful as she expected, and although she doesn&rsquo;t hold any grudge towards the reggaeton artists she collaborated with, she still received an unfair treatment in which also received no legal advice. In 2022, she was reached by Anuel AA, an international well-known trap and reggaeton artist because he wanted to record a remake of Hector El Father&rsquo;s Classic &ldquo;Tu quieres duro&rdquo;, this time, Anuel gave him proper credits and royalties and treated her fairly. Currently, she works in a jewelry shop in New York and is not working on music, although she has expressed her will to return to the music industry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">There are several stories like this inside the reggaeton industry and genre, it is important to appreciate art that we consume, but also make sure that people involved in the art we enjoy, are receiving the proper credit they deserve.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13">&nbsp;Conclusion: Reggaet&oacute;n as Cultural Identity</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Despite countless injustices within the genre, reggaet&oacute;n remains a powerful musical movement rooted in the neighborhoods, the streets and the cultural exchange of several Caribbean countries as well as the incorporation of other genres like Salsa which is already a cultural blend of several cultures. The influence Reggaeton has had in music over the last 30 years is undeniable and although 20 years ago, it was a genre seem as trashy, distasteful to common sense and low-class, the musical movement has evolved into an empire, not exclusive to people from &ldquo;El barrio&rdquo; but to everyone who enjoys perreo despite their socio-economic status, gender and identity. Artists like Tainy and Bad Bunny are continually working on innovating this musical movement without losing its essence and even artists that are not known as reggaeton artists have tried combining their style with it, as it was seen with artists like Snoop Dogg, Shakira, V&iacute;ctor Manuelle and even Miguel Bos&eacute;. Reggaeton has already made its musical footprint and nowadays, more than 20 years after they tried to censor it, there is now a movement for the recognition of Reggaeton as cultural heritage of Puerto Rico, after all&ldquo;Even if reggaet&oacute;n was not officially born on the island, Puerto Ricans perfected it, making it the island&rsquo;s most listened-to genre.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c13">Bibliography:</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Sixty-Five Members of the Angel Ayala Vazquez Drug Trafficking Organization Indicted $100 Million Forfeiture Count.&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c10">FBI</span><span class="c7">, 2 Oct. 2009,</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fbi.gov/sanjuan/press-releases/2009/sj100209.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011137640&amp;usg=AOvVaw22OaFaPmNdWGw_GQ7bSjy9">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fbi.gov/sanjuan/press-releases/2009/sj100209.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754446011138020&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OeJCcobajv9KVNBqRm8EF">https://www.fbi.gov/sanjuan/press-releases/2009/sj100209.htm</a></span><span class="c5">.
